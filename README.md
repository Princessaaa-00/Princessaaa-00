Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on a mini project that involves creating a secure sign up and login page that should log
one into a page that displays their details .ie.(registration number and name). It is still underway! 
I have tried to implement a few of OWASPs Top Ten into this and I am still learning. The ultimate goal is to try and implement secure coding principles in this. 
Here's what I have so far and there is room for improvement! Feel free to ask me about anything on this project and anything you may want to add.
